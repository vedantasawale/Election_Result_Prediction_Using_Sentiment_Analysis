# Election_Result_Prediction_Using_Sentiment_Analysis
It a full fledged Data Science Project focussing on Text Analysis to Predict the Election Results .
We successfully predicted the Election results in India using data used from Twitter and the Formula which we developed based on our understanding of the Indian Election System along with NLP techniques.
We have also created a tool with a UI where you can select the Political party and find Sentiment towards that party at runtime.
The Data from Twitter is used for this Project.
